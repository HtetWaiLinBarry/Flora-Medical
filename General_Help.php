		<tr>
			<td>Doctors are able to view the appointments that the patients have booked and will always be able to get access to them as long as you log into our system. To view the appointments, simple choose Appointment Arrangement from the Booking section which will then redirect you to confirm your account login once more.</td>
		</tr>
		<th>Step One : View appointments</th>
		<tr>
			<td>Patients will have their own desired times and dates that you will be able to check using the View system. Choose the one you are more okay with.</td>
		</tr>
		<th>Step Two : Confirm</th>
		<tr>
			<td>Doctors can choose whether to confirm a patient's booked appointment or not. They will also be able to move the appointment to another date.</td>
		</tr>
		<th>
			Step Three : Delete
		</th>
		<tr>
			<td>Some appointments can be annoying to doctors and if they were, doctors can choose to delete those appointments.</td>
		</tr>
		<th>You can always choose the appointment you want to confirm, or move some to another date. However, some of the consequences for doing this are not our responsibility and they are solely yours. During some times, if a patient were to try to contact a doctor through other means, we will try to help the patient through the customer service / the care service. We are a medical cares service and we solely use the system we have to help as much people as we can.</th>
